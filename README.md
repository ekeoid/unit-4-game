# Unit-4-Game (Star Wars RPG)

### Overview

This game is similar to a card deck game, but themed with Star Wars. This is bootcamp homework assignment #4. The game only starts with 4 cards and you need to select your player, while the rest of the cards become enemies. Your goal is to try to defeat all enemies but choosing the smart sequence to defeat them. All player attacks are cumulatively additive based on the number attacks performed as the game session progresses.

You can find the instructions for this assignment here: [homework-instructions.md][]

The rest of this README will overview the interpretation of the game.
